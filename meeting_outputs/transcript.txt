 Good morning everyone, let's keep this quick. How's the progress on the new website update? The design part is done. I've shared the final mock-up for review. Great, I'll start integrating those designs into frontend today. So I'll be done by tomorrow evening. Once Sam's done, I'll run the final test and check for bugs before deployment. Perfect, let's aim to go live by Friday. Thanks team, great coordination. Thanks Alex.
